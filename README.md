## Group Overview

We are a group of diverse scientists, researchers, and developers dedicated to studying and understanding the potential impacts of storm surges caused by landfalling tropical cyclones. Our primary focus is on providing accurate and timely information to decision-makers and first responders to support their preparedness efforts and ultimately save lives.

## Objective

The objective of our project is to simulate and visualize storm surges associated with tropical cyclones using advanced computer models and cutting-edge technology. By leveraging the power of supercomputers, we aim to provide detailed and up-to-date storm surge projections that can assist in forecasting and emergency planning.

## Key Components

Our operations  comprises several key components that work together seamlessly to achieve our goals:

1. **ADCIRC Model**: We utilize the ADCIRC (Advanced Circulation) model, which has a proven track record of success spanning over 25 years. This sophisticated computer model is specifically designed to calculate storm surges based on the latest official hurricane forecast track. It takes into account various factors such as wind speeds, atmospheric pressure, and coastline geometry to generate accurate surge predictions.

2. **ADCIRC Surge Guidance System (ASGS)**: To ensure our storm surge projections are always up to date, we have developed a powerful software package called ASGS. This system runs on high-performance computers and automatically recalculates and updates the ADCIRC projections each time a new forecast advisory is issued. ASGS enables us to provide the most current and accurate storm surge information to our users. [Storm Surge Live asgs Repository](https://github.com/StormSurgeLive/asgs).

3. **Coastal Emergency Risks Assessment (CERA)**: We present our storm surge maps on an interactive web mapper known as CERA. This user-friendly platform allows decision-makers, first responders, and the public to easily access and visualize the potential impacts and timing of storm surges. By providing comprehensive information, CERA empowers users to make informed decisions and take proactive measures to mitigate the risks associated with landfalling tropical cyclones.

## Getting Involved

We welcome collaboration and contributions from individuals and organizations who share our vision of improving storm surge preparedness. If you are interested in joining our efforts, please explore the resources below:

- **Code Repository**: Our GitHub repository houses the several tutorials for the storm surge visualization . You can find the latest code, documentation, and instructions for getting started at [CERA Contouring Matplotlib](https://github.com/CERA-GROUP/CERA_Contouring_Matplotlib).
- **Historical Storm Web**:Our newly launched website includes more than 50 tropical storms that involved injury or loss of life, incurred damages to property, and made significant economic impact. [historicalstorms.coastalrisk.live](https://historicalstorms.coastalrisk.live/)
- **Historical Storm Data Archive**: This project provides storm surge, wind, and wave model results for 62 named tropical storms and hurricanes which struck the U.S. Northern Gulf and Atlantic coasts in the past 20 years. The project utilized the ADCIRC Surge Guidance System framework and wind data from the National Hurricane Center to generate hindcast model output from ADCIRC and SWAN. The model output files are in the NetCDF file format and include water levels, wind, and significant wave height information.
