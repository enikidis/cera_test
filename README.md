## Group Overview
<picture> <img align="right" src="https://github.com/7oSkaaa/7oSkaaa/blob/main/Images/Right_Side.gif?raw=true" width = 180px></picture>
We are a group of diverse scientists, researchers, and developers dedicated to studying and understanding the potential impacts of storm surge and inland flooding caused by landfalling tropical cyclones. Our primary focus is on providing accurate and timely information to decision-makers and first responders to support their preparedness efforts and ultimately save lives.

   
## Objective

The objective of our project is to simulate and visualize storm surge associated with tropical cyclones using advanced computer models and cutting-edge technology. By leveraging the power of supercomputers, we aim to provide detailed and up-to-date storm surge projections that can assist in forecasting and emergency planning.

## Key Components

**Coastal Emergency Risks Assessment (CERA)**: We present our storm surge maps on an interactive web mapper known as CERA. This user-friendly platform allows decision-makers, first responders, and the public to easily access and visualize the potential impacts and timing of storm surge and flooding. By providing comprehensive information, CERA empowers users to make informed decisions and take proactive measures to mitigate the risks associated with landfalling tropical storms.

Our operations involve collaborating  with high profile partners:

1. **ADCIRC Surge Guidance System (ASGS)**: Providing real-time ADCIRC storm surge simulations on high-performance computers. [Storm Surge Live ASGS Repository](https://github.com/StormSurgeLive/asgs).

2. **NOAA Coastal Survey Development Lab (NOAA CSDL)**: Providing daily operational wind and water height simulations using the ADCIRC and SCHISM models. [NOAA CSDL Website](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/csdl.html).

3. **CeHydro**: Providing a compound flooding model for the state of Louisiana, combining storm surge and rainfall impacts. [CeHydro's Website](http://www.cehydro.com/).
   
## Getting Involved

We welcome collaboration and contributions from individuals and organizations who share our vision of improving storm surge preparedness. If you are interested in joining our efforts, please explore the resources below:

<!--- **Code Repository**: Our GitHub repository houses several tutorials for storm surge visualization. You can find the latest code, documentation, and instructions for getting started at [CERA Contouring Matplotlib](https://github.com/CERA-GROUP/CERA_Contouring_Matplotlib).-->
- **Daily forecasts** - We provide daily conditions for wind and water heights covering the US Atlantic and Nothern Gulf on our interactive CERA web mapper [cera.coastalrisk.live](https://cera.coastalrisk.live/)
- **Historical Storms Web**: Our newly launched website includes more than 60 tropical storms that involved injury or loss of life, incurred damages to property, and made significant economic impact. [historicalstorms.coastalrisk.live](https://historicalstorms.coastalrisk.live/)
- **Historical Storm Data Archive**: This project provides storm surge, wind, and wave model results for 62 named tropical storms and hurricanes which struck the U.S. Northern Gulf and Atlantic coasts in the past 20 years. The project utilized the ADCIRC Surge Guidance System framework and wind data from the National Hurricane Center to generate hindcast model output from ADCIRC and SWAN. The model output files are in the NetCDF file format and include water levels, wind, and significant wave height information.
