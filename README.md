## Group Overview
<picture> <img align="right" src="https://github.com/7oSkaaa/7oSkaaa/blob/main/Images/Right_Side.gif?raw=true" width = 180px></picture>
We are a group of diverse scientists, researchers, and developers dedicated to studying and understanding the potential impacts of storm surges caused by landfalling tropical cyclones. Our primary focus is on providing accurate and timely information to decision-makers and first responders to support their preparedness efforts and ultimately save lives.

   
## Objective

The objective of our project is to simulate and visualize storm surges associated with tropical cyclones using advanced computer models and cutting-edge technology. By leveraging the power of supercomputers, we aim to provide detailed and up-to-date storm surge projections that can assist in forecasting and emergency planning.

## Key Components

**Coastal Emergency Risks Assessment (CERA)**: We present our storm surge maps on an interactive web mapper known as CERA. This user-friendly platform allows decision-makers, first responders, and the public to easily access and visualize the potential impacts and timing of storm surges. By providing comprehensive information, CERA empowers users to make informed decisions and take proactive measures to mitigate the risks associated with landfalling tropical storms.

Our operations involve collaborating  with high profile partners:

1. **ADCIRC Surge Guidance System (ASGS)**: Providing storm surge simulations on high-performance computers. [Storm Surge Live asgs Repository](https://github.com/StormSurgeLive/asgs).

2. **NOAA Coast Survey Group**: Providing real time simulations using ADCIRC and  SCHISM models. [NOAA's Coast Survey Website](https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/).

3. **CeHydro**: Compound flooding model for Louisiana. [CeHydro's Website](http://www.cehydro.com/).
## Getting Involved

We welcome collaboration and contributions from individuals and organizations who share our vision of improving storm surge preparedness. If you are interested in joining our efforts, please explore the resources below:

- **Code Repository**: Our GitHub repository houses the several tutorials for the storm surge visualization . You can find the latest code, documentation, and instructions for getting started at [CERA Contouring Matplotlib](https://github.com/CERA-GROUP/CERA_Contouring_Matplotlib).
- **Historical Storm Web**: Our newly launched website includes more than 50 tropical storms that involved injury or loss of life, incurred damages to property, and made significant economic impact. [historicalstorms.coastalrisk.live](https://historicalstorms.coastalrisk.live/)
- **Historical Storm Data Archive**: This project provides storm surge, wind, and wave model results for 62 named tropical storms and hurricanes which struck the U.S. Northern Gulf and Atlantic coasts in the past 20 years. The project utilized the ADCIRC Surge Guidance System framework and wind data from the National Hurricane Center to generate hindcast model output from ADCIRC and SWAN. The model output files are in the NetCDF file format and include water levels, wind, and significant wave height information.
